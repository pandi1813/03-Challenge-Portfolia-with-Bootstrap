## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Bootstrap styling
- Mobile-first workflow



### What I learned

What Bootstrap is and how we can use it to speed up the styling of our websites


```html
 <div class="card  custom-card col-lg-3 col-md-5 col-sm-12">
      <a href="">
        <img src="https://placehold.co/600x400" class="card-img-top" alt="...">
        <div class="card-body">
          <h4 class="card-title">Project title</h4>
          <p class="card-text">Some quick example text to build on the card title and make up the bulk of the card's content.</p>
        </div>
      </a>
    </div>
```
```html
 <section id="about" class="about row ">
    <div class="col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-12">
      <h2 class="section-header">About Me</h2>
```


### Continued development

I would like to practice how to customize Bootstrap designs and analyze websites to understand how they were styled.
 

### Useful resources
